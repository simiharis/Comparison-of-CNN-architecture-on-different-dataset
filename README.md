# Comparison-of-CNN-architecture-on-different-dataset
A project that compares the performance of different CNN architectures on various data sets.

      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network designed primarily for processing structured data like images and videos. They leverage convolutional layers to extract meaningful patterns (e.g., edges, textures, shapes) from the input data, making them highly effective for image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more.

Key Goals

Evaluate various CNN architectures: LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, SENet.
Analyze their performance on three datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10.
Provide insights into selecting the best architecture based on dataset characteristics and performance metrics.
